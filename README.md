# HTML-CSS-JavaScript-capstone-project

>This Project is called Capstone which simply means Final Project in which I summarize my knowledge in HTML, CSS and
a little bit of javaScript.

## Project Name
## International Festival Theatre in Kumasi GHANA
This project was our capstone project for module 1-HTML/CSS. The project was to build about any conference/summit. I created a Software Development Conference website for people who want to know more about a festival in Kumasi.
